# 🐧 Linux File Permissions Project

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this project was to explore, understand, and modify file and directory permissions in a Linux environment, gaining hands-on experience with permission structures, the `chmod` command, and security best practices.

## 🔍 Step 1: Viewing File Permissions



To check file and directory permissions in Linux, the `ls -la` command was used:

```bash
ls -la
```
Example output:
```bash
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user  1234 Aug 10 12:34 example.txt
drwxrwxr-x 2 user user  4096 Aug 10 12:34 my_folder
```
